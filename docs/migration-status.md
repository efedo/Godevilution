## Implemented authoritative systems

- Handshake validation, bounded framing, retry/deduplication, reconnect tokens,
  acknowledgements, snapshots, events, and state hashes.
- Network snapshots now atomically capture every assigned participant. The
  receiver is first for local-client identity, remote players follow by entity
  ID, and canonical hashing sorts the full set so receiver-relative player
  order cannot create a deterministic mismatch.
- Player movement, occupancy, portals, resources, levels, status effects,
  combat, spells, projectiles, monsters, drops, and world-item pickup.
- Store stock, purchases, sales, services, equipment, belt, inventory placement,
  item generation, affixes, and unique items for the current shipped slice.
- The external class and loadout catalogs define all six native-compatible
  Diablo and Hellfire classes, a content-selected default, starting attributes,
  combat metadata, wallets, equipment, belt and inventory placements, class
  skills, and learned spells. Native and Godot clients can select an
  active-content class for a new session; the server creates independent state
  with native Q6 life/mana formulas and deterministic item seeds, while an
  in-memory or saved participant wins on reconnect. Class and spell identity
  flow through simulation state, protocol snapshots, saves, native projection,
  overlays, and cross-language canonical hashes.
- New sessions may also request a native-valid character name. The server owns
  it thereafter and preserves it through participant state, saves, protocol
  field 28, conditional canonical hashes, reconnect, and native/Godot
  projection. Lethal player damage now creates the native-compatible PvP ear
  from that name, class cursor, character level, and external item definition;
  equipment remains equipped and suppressed multiplayer levels omit the ear.
- Objects, declarative object effects, linked quest progress, and multi-level
  entity persistence.
- Versioned server-owned saves with validation and atomic replacement.
- Native and Godot protocol clients plus shared replay and live-server tests.
- Engine-neutral inventory-grid geometry, footprint validation, placement, and
  index compaction extracted into the dependency-free `Devilution.Domain`
  assembly with an independent test project.
- Canonical deterministic hashing moved into `Devilution.Domain`; generic TSV
  parsing, ordered content packs, manifest identity, and stable content IDs moved
  into the independent `Devilution.Data` assembly with native golden vectors.
- Diablo item/store/combat/monster/spell/world schemas and deterministic store
  rules plus protocol-independent authoritative player/store state moved into
  `Devilution.Diablo`, with the shipped base pack tested without referencing the
  server or protocol.
- Store, service, inventory-placement, and inventory/belt/equipment transfer
  commands now cross protocol-neutral intents and results; the server maps
  Protobuf commands and rejection codes without owning those state transitions.
- Authoritative world collections, walkability, line of sight, occupancy,
  initial-world validation, movement, portals, pickup, object effects, quest
  transitions, and their transient events now live in `Devilution.Diablo`.
  The server maps Protobuf commands, rejection codes, snapshots, and event
  messages around that module-owned boundary.
- Attack and cast intents, typed damage, experience and drop resolution,
  projectiles, status expiry, monster targeting, movement, attacks, and
  per-player transient event delivery now execute inside `Devilution.Diablo`.
  The host only supplies stable player order and authoritative tick numbers.
- Cast admission now verifies an authoritative class ability, learned spell,
  charged left-hand staff, or exact inventory/belt scroll or rune. Abilities are
  free, memorized spells consume mana, charged items lose one charge, and
  consumables are removed only after all target validation succeeds. Native and
  Godot clients send the selected source; source-zero compatibility commands can
  infer only an actually owned source in a stable order.
- Content activation cross-validates every directly castable starting learned,
  charged-item, scroll, and rune source against `spells.tsv`. Class-skill IDs are
  kept distinct because repair, recharge, trap disarm, and similar native
  capabilities are cursor-driven interactions rather than ordinary casts.
- The base Sorcerer staff's native spell ID 30 is now an external typed Charged
  Bolt definition. One accepted cast consumes its source once and creates
  `4 + floor(effective spell level / 2)` server-owned bolts using the native
  Diablo LCG draw order, Magic-based damage, 16.16 isometric wandering cadence,
  magic hit roll, and lightning resistance/immunity behavior. Gameplay RNG and
  all path/velocity/phase fields persist through snapshots and saves.
- `Devilution.Engine` now owns transport-neutral module identity, dependency
  ordering, transactional typed capabilities, authoritative clock context, and
  ordered ruleset identity. `DiabloModule` registers its store rules and
  simulation factory, which constructs one aggregate over shared Diablo state.
- Generic Engine session coordination now owns deterministic state ordering,
  reverse participant lookup, explicit participant-state registration, and
  per-session transient event queues. Diablo
  owns stable player/world/store snapshot capture and restore validation; a
  dedicated Diablo adapter maps those projections to Protobuf, state hashes,
  events, and the compatible version-1 save envelope.
- The Engine runtime now serializes participant reads, writes, command steps,
  captures, and autonomous advancement; owns the last-applied tick; and routes
  module-directed events. Diablo supplies normalized player templates and
  lifecycle hooks. The Diablo adapter save codec explicitly dispatches format
  version 1 while retaining the existing JSON/base64/Protobuf representation.
- Data now composes ordered external packs with explicit composite-key upserts,
  exact ordered-column checks, deterministic row placement, and atomic candidate
  activation. The standalone server consumes the effective tables for every
  Diablo catalog, and live protocol tests prove overlays change authoritative
  store state and the content-selected default player class.
- Engine now exposes semantic API versions and deterministic module inspection.
  Duplicate IDs, missing or cyclic dependencies, and incompatible API ranges
  produce actionable diagnostics before registration; the host supplies the
  trusted candidate set explicitly.
- Modules may constrain each named dependency to an inclusive three-component
  semantic-version range. Preflight rejects non-semantic or out-of-range loaded
  versions before registration, verified package wrappers retain the declared
  requirements, and non-empty constraints extend the ruleset identity without
  changing legacy unconstrained hashes.
- Engine now offers all-or-nothing module activation without changing the
  compatibility `Load` API. A generic ruleset runtime composes Data, activates
  a complete module candidate set, computes its identity, and runs a
  game-specific validation callback before atomically publishing any of them.
  Failed content, compatibility, registration, identity, or target validation
  retains the exact previous activation with a stage-specific diagnostic. The
  standalone server uses this coordinated boundary for initial activation.
- Data now accepts versioned content-schema identities and inclusive semantic
  dependency ranges, hashes them when declared, and preserves every legacy
  content golden vector when omitted. The first-party Diablo module rejects a
  declared schema that does not match its contract.
- Host now owns a format-1 external module-package policy: explicit package
  roots, primary-DLL SHA-256 verification, named-type activation, verified code
  identities, and rejection of private managed/native dependencies. A
  process-level test proves the standalone host loads and reports a package;
  Engine remains unaware of files and reflection.
- `IDiabloContentBootstrap` now owns schema compatibility, all normalized and
  legacy table selection, catalog validation, service rules, default-class and
  default-level selection, and simulation construction. Server `Program`
  supplies generic composed content and player-start settings; a boundary test prevents TSV
  names and Diablo catalog constructors from returning to executable startup.
- A generic Server adapter catalog now contributes built-in module candidates
  and selects exactly one compatible combined command/tick/snapshot/event/save
  adapter. Only the built-in Diablo bridge resolves Diablo capabilities or
  constructs the protocol executor; executable `Program` contains no Diablo
  symbols, enforced by tests.
- Managed Protobuf generation now occurs once in `Devilution.Protocol` and is
  shared by Server and Godot. Generic transport, sessions, scheduling, package
  loading, snapshot hashing, and filesystem persistence live in
  `Devilution.Server.Host`, which has no Diablo dependency. Mapping, compatible
  saves, replay helpers, and the protocol executor live in
  `Devilution.Server.Diablo`; the .NET 10 executable contains only `Program.cs`.
  Exact assembly-reference and schema-ownership tests enforce this graph.

## Architectural debt

The process boundary is authoritative and the intended internal C# dependency
direction is now enforced through separate Domain, Data, Engine, Diablo,
Protocol, generic Host, Diablo adapter, and composition assemblies. All
gameplay transitions in the current vertical slice are module-owned and
composed by a registered `DiabloSimulation` factory. Engine owns generic
session/state coordination; Diablo owns transport-neutral state and validation;
the adapter alone owns Diablo/Protobuf mapping and compatible saves; Host owns
generic network and operational behavior. Remaining debt is behavioral and
extensibility work rather than a collapsed project boundary: the adapter still
retains the legacy-named protocol executor and replay helpers, format-1 packages
provide gameplay modules rather than host adapters, live ruleset replacement
still needs session migration and safe old-target retirement, and authoritative
content/gameplay coverage is still partial. Cast source ownership and immediate
resource consumption are now authoritative, and every directly castable base
loadout source resolves during activation, but the spell catalog still models
only the current healing, damage, area, status, and projectile slice. Charged
Bolt count, creation RNG order, Magic-based damage, wandering movement, magic
hit chance, Q6-before-resistance damage, fractional monster health, events,
persistence, separate missile geometry, swept tile checks, stationary-occupant
suppression, external object pass-through/breakability/destruction, and shared
C++/C# spawn, resolution, object-collision, and moving-occupancy checkpoints are
now covered. Moving monsters preserve current and future occupancy, normal
walkers collide only at their current tile, petrified walkers freeze and become
hittable at both tiles, and death cancels movement. This state crosses
snapshots, saves, hashes, native signed occupancy, and replay validation.
Firebolt now has a content-selected native behavior rather than the provisional
targeted-projectile path. The server derives class- and variant-adjusted Q6
mana, seeded magic/spell-level damage, 16.16 speed-26 movement, swept collision,
magic hit chance, quarter resistance damage, and impact expiry from schema 0.9
content. Protocol-neutral snapshots, version-1 saves, canonical hashes, parser
validation, and a shared three-checkpoint C++/C# replay preserve its exact
fractional-health and RNG boundary.
Lightning now uses a content-selected invisible controller and persistent
stationary segments. Schema 0.10 externalizes its speed, controller lifetime,
per-update randomized Q6 damage, positive-resistance divisor, and segment
lifetime scaling. The server preserves same-tick segment processing, repeated
collision, magic-hit and petrification RNG, PvP damage, and the native rule that
a blocking object stops the controller without breaking it. Effective spell
level and all controller/segment state cross protocol field 29, snapshots,
saves, hashes, native projection, and a shared four-checkpoint C++/C# replay.
Flash now uses two content-selected, runtime-owned stationary layers centered on
the player. Schema 0.11 externalizes its 19-tick lifetime, independent
character-level damage rolls, effective-level scaling, post-scale bonus, magic
resistance divisor, and mana tuning. The server preserves the native six-cell
Bottom and three-cell Top ordering, repeated exact-Q6 collision, petrification
and hit RNG, non-expiring wall/object collision, breakable-object destruction,
PvP rules, and the invulnerability window from the first processed layer through
final removal. Layer state and magic resistance cross snapshots, saves, hashes,
protocol projection, strict replay parsing, and a shared four-checkpoint C++/C#
timeline.
Healing now uses a content-selected immediate self effect. Schema 0.12
externalizes the initial, per-character-level, and per-effective-spell-level
random rolls, Q6 scale, and class multiplier. The server preserves native mana,
RNG, and full-life cast consumption, caps only the applied healing, and carries
the exact applied Q6 amount through an additive event field without changing the
legacy native amount. A shared three-checkpoint C++/C# replay proves uncapped,
capped, and already-full casts from one continuous RNG stream.
Teleport now uses a content-selected invisible movement controller. Schema 0.13
activates its exact mana tuning and stationary two-tick lifetime. The server
preserves native radius-0-through-5 `DoCrawl` order, static, monster, object,
and participant occupancy, source-preserving fizzle, and destination
revalidation after the monster phase before moving the player. Controller and
player state cross snapshots, version-1 saves, existing protocol fields,
native/Godot presentation, and a shared four-checkpoint C++/C# replay.
Resurrection now uses a content-selected immediate player-target effect plus a
runtime-owned beam. Schema 0.14 externalizes its fixed-minimum mana, native
range, 16-tick beam lifetime, revived life, life scale, and radius-50 placement
limit. The server preserves native other-player admission, living-target beam
behavior, dead-player action cancellation, zero-mana and ten-life reset,
initial-offset and crawl placement, actor/object/static occupancy, and portal
avoidance during the fallback crawl. Complete participant and beam state cross
snapshots, compatible saves, existing protocol fields, Godot presentation,
native target mapping, and a shared five-checkpoint C++/C# replay. The native
adapter retains all remote participant projections for targeting but does not
yet construct full legacy remote-player presentation objects from them.
Mana Shield now uses a content-selected immediate self effect. Schema 0.19
externalizes its native damage-reduction base divisor, per-learned-level step,
and level cap. The first cast consumes its source; an active recast fizzles
without consumption. One module-owned resolver now applies the native Q6
damage-to-mana conversion and depletion reversal to monster, PvP projectile,
and damaging-object paths, including exact-depletion cleanup and NoMana-item
bypass. Active state crosses snapshots, compatible saves, additive protocol
field 29, conditional hashes, native/Godot presentation, and a shared six-
checkpoint C++/C# replay. Level-changing transitions and Resurrection clear it.
Stone Curse now uses a content-selected monster-target controller. Schema 0.20
externalizes its mana adjustment/floor, native crawl radius, duration base/cap/
scale, shatter lifetime, and per-monster immunity. The server preserves the
native no-target fizzle, consumes without refresh on an already-petrified
target, searches both cells of a walking monster, freezes pending movement,
releases a living monster at expiry, and retains petrification through the
dead-target shatter phase. Controller state, effective spell level, immunity,
and occupancy cross snapshots, compatible saves, additive monster field 22,
conditional hashes, native/Godot presentation, and a shared six-checkpoint
C++/C# replay.
Infravision now uses a content-selected immediate self status. Schema 0.21
externalizes its mana adjustment/floor, status identity, base duration, and
per-level duration-growth divisor. The server validates learned, ability,
scroll, and rune sources; consumes the exact accepted source; applies native
class mana rules only when appropriate; unions recast duration; owns expiry;
and clears the typed effect during level-changing portal and restart transitions
without removing generic statuses. Typed behavior crosses snapshots, compatible
saves, additive status field 4, conditional hashes, native/Godot presentation,
and a shared four-checkpoint C++/C# replay.
Phasing now uses a content-selected invisible movement controller. Schema 0.22
externalizes its mana adjustment/floor and minimum/maximum axis offsets. The
server ignores client target coordinates, enumerates the native 36 candidate
tiles against complete authoritative occupancy, consumes one RNG draw only
when candidates exist, and preserves facing. A successful selection creates a
two-tick controller whose first update revalidates through the shared Teleport
crawl; an empty set creates nothing and advances no RNG but still consumes the
accepted source. Controller state, RNG, resources, and resulting position cross
snapshots, compatible saves, existing protocol fields, conditional hashes,
native/Godot projection, and a shared four-checkpoint C++/C# replay.
Fireball now uses a content-selected native projectile and impact controller.
Schema 0.23 externalizes its mana floor, two-roll damage formula, per-level
damage growth, capped speed growth, fire-resistance divisor, and explosion
lifetime. The server preserves swept direct collision, native shifted 3x3
splash ordering, origin-to-cell solid blocking, object breakage, exact Q6
damage, and the 14-tick stationary explosion. Runtime phase, velocity, origin,
damage, RNG, exact health, and remaining lifetime cross snapshots, compatible
saves, existing protocol fields, native/Godot presentation, conditional hashes,
and a shared four-checkpoint C++/C# replay.
Heal Other now uses a content-selected immediate living-player effect. Schema
0.24 reuses Healing's native randomized Q6 formula and mana rules while
externalizing a separate per-class multiplier, including the Monk's distinct
300-percent result. The server validates the stable target ID, other-player,
living, same-level, and range rules before mutation, then owns source
consumption, RNG, cap, exact healing event, and participant snapshot update. A
shared timed three-checkpoint C++/C# multiplayer replay proves the transition.
Search now uses a content-selected immediate self status. Schema 0.25 makes the
Monk's external spell-46 ability executable and externalizes its base,
character-level, and spell-level duration terms. The server preserves native
additive recasts and the signed-int overflow guard, owns expiry and transition
cleanup, and projects typed behavior 2 to Godot item outlines and the native
automap flag. Compatible saves, conditional hashes, and a shared four-checkpoint
C++/C# replay carry the same state.
The Bard's Identify skill is now a server-owned item action. Schema 0.26 binds
the loadout's spell-5 declaration to the stable `spell:identify` identity, and
an additive protocol source distinguishes it from paid vendor identification.
The server validates ability ownership and the exact equipment or inventory
item, charges no Gold for the skill, and remains the only writer of identified
state. Native and Godot clients provide selection and presentation only.
The Warrior's Repair skill is now a server-owned item action. Schema 0.27 binds
spell `26` to stable `spell:repair`; the server validates class-skill ownership
and the exact equipment or inventory item, then preserves native level-scaled
random repair, iterative maximum-durability loss, full-item no-op behavior, item
exhaustion, and RNG state. Source zero remains paid full vendor repair, while
native and Godot clients only select an item and render the returned snapshot.
The Sorcerer's Staff Recharge skill is now server-owned under schema 0.28.
Stable `spell:recharge` identity `27` binds the live loadout to the item-service
policy, while `spells.tsv` externalizes native staff levels. The server validates
the exact staff, owns the single recharge-strength RNG roll, permanently reduces
maximum charges, and preserves full-item and exhaustion outcomes. Source zero
remains paid full vendor recharge; clients perform selection and presentation
only.
Restart in Town is now a transport-neutral, server-owned terminal-death
transition. Schema 0.15 adds a validated town level, explicit default-start
level, destination tile, one-whole-point Q6 life reset, and transition duration.
The command is admitted only after the Death action has cleared, preserves
inventory, sets mana to zero, clears the nullable active-store state, applies
the destination immediately, and holds NewLevel for one tick before Stand.
Protocol field 27, action kind 6, both presentation clients, version-1 saves,
conditional hashes, and a six-checkpoint C++/C# dungeon-death-to-town replay
carry the same result. The native adapter invokes only the legacy town-loading
presentation after the accepted server snapshot; it does not resolve the
restart locally.
Ordinary combat-death gold handling is now server-owned under schema 0.16.
Validated content selects the divisor, projected stack cap, native Gold
identity, and search radius. Death cancels movement before radius-1-through-50
crawl placement, retains and drops independently truncated halves, assigns
nonzero seeds from the shared RNG, and exposes the results as ordinary world
items. When canonical Gold piles are present, death now follows the native
two-pass inventory order, reuses seeds for whole piles, creates one seed for a
partial split, compacts the grid, and retains the physical odd remainder behind
the truncated wallet cache. Topology-aware pickup tops off piles and uses native
last-row/column placement before recalculating the wallet. If only part of a
world Gold pile fits, the server removes the world entity, retains the original
seed and remaining value as the player's cursor-held item, and excludes that
remainder from the wallet. The held item can be dropped onto a valid nearby
tile relative to the player's reserved movement destination and is also dropped
before Gold when the player dies. Aggregate-only saves
retain the prior compatible balance path. Focused tests cover multi-pile order,
seed reuse, grid compaction, persistence/recovery, placement, malformed saves,
and the legacy full-grid fallback. Shared C++/C# replays hash both the death
topology and a full-inventory partial pickup followed by an identity-preserving
held-item drop.
Schema 0.17 preserves the native multiplayer exception for level 16 and
arena-equivalent maps. The host owns explicit single-player/multiplayer mode,
projects it in `ServerHello`, and passes it through the generic adapter boundary
to the Diablo simulation. Validated level content marks maps that suppress
multiplayer death consequences. On those maps Gold and RNG state remain
unchanged, while a cursor-held item still follows the native unconditional
death-drop path. A shared C++/C# fixture proves the rule without inferring mode
from connected participant count.
New content-backed participants now start with canonical Gold piles instead of
an aggregate-only wallet. The first pile occupies native cell 30, overflow uses
native Gold placement order, and deterministic session-derived nonzero seeds
remain distinct from starting-item seeds. Store purchases and services spend
nonmaximum piles before maximum piles without changing retained seeds;
canonical purchases receive a native-order inventory footprint. Sales top off
existing piles, allocate seeded piles only when needed, compact the sold-item
footprint, reject transactionally when proceeds do not fit, and preserve the
post-death physical/cache remainder. Direct transfers and swaps reject any
result that would place Gold in equipment or the belt. A five-checkpoint shared
C++/C# store replay proves purchase, sale, mana service, pile value/seed, grid,
wallet, and the one RNG draw used to create sale proceeds after an exact-balance
purchase.
Charged Bolt now also resolves player collision with native friendly/global
admission, hit, equipment/class blocking, lightning resistance, exact Q6
damage, and RNG order. Explicit friendly-mode commands are retry-safe, hostile
state crosses protocol, saves, native/Godot controls, and conditional hashes,
and a two-participant C++/C# replay verifies the collision timeline. Player
combat mode is now server-owned and persisted; only Stand and melee Attack may
block, class block/recovery frames and usable speed flags determine transient
durations, same-tick bolts observe the immediate mode change, and a shared
Hellfire replay verifies the expansion-only post-block RNG draw. The activated
module lifecycle now reserves player walk destinations, defers melee/ranged
damage and spell resource/effect resolution to native action frames, permits
attack/cast chaining only at native boundaries, and distinguishes base-game
from Hellfire bow-speed behavior. Current-action state crosses module snapshots,
protocol field 25, version-1 saves, conditional hashes, and native/Godot
projection. A shared C++/C# command timeline verifies deferred movement, melee
damage, attack-to-cast chaining, spell consumption/effects, and cleanup at seven
checkpoints. Two additional shared timelines carry a fast Bow as hashed initial
equipment and prove nonadjacent ranged admission plus the one-tick Diablo versus
Hellfire effect/ready-boundary difference. Focused module tests retain broader
melee speed-tier coverage. Lethal monster or Charged Bolt damage now cancels an
in-progress action, starts a content-timed Death action, and leaves the player
in terminal Death mode after animation cleanup. Portal use applies the
authoritative destination behind a one-tick NewLevel action barrier before
returning a living player to Stand. Both action kinds cross protocol field 25,
version-1 saves, conditional hashes, and native/Godot validation. Shared C++/C#
timelines prove autonomous monster approach, movement cancellation, the
content-owned death duration, terminal cleanup, one-stack Gold topology,
placement and RNG state, immediate portal destination, and transition cleanup.
Server-owned facing now follows accepted move, attack, and resolved cast
directions and crosses protocol field 27, saves, hashes, native projection, and
Godot validation. On ordinary monster-or-trap death, equipment is removed in
native Head-through-Chest slot order while facing rotates left once per slot;
each item uses its preferred adjacent tile before the shared crawl, preserving
seed and full state without RNG. PvP and special-level multiplayer deaths retain
equipment. A shared two-checkpoint C++/C# replay proves the rotated positions,
occupied-tile fallback, and identified-value world price. Lethal player damage
now retains equipment and creates one native-compatible ear on the shared death
crawl. The victim name deterministically supplies create-info and seed, the
victim level supplies value, the activated class supplies cursor graphic, and
schema-0.18 combat/item content supplies stable item identity. Runtime names
and cursor cross protocol, saves, both clients, and conditional hashes; a shared
C++/C# replay proves death, exact ear state, placement, and unchanged ear-drop
RNG. Remaining spell scaling and class modifiers, targeting edge cases,
cursor-driven class capabilities, and a complete Godot spell-selection UI
remain migration work.

Content schema 0.8 moves block/recovery timing out of `classes.tsv` and imports
the complete native six-class animation matrix into validated
`class_animations.tsv`. Weapon-specific attack/action pairs and walk, death,
cast, recovery, block, and town frames now share one content-owned source for
the command-lifecycle work instead of remaining native-only presentation data.

Content schema 0.9 adds native spell-mana adjustment, minimum, unit scaling,
and Firebolt damage-scaling columns plus per-class base/Hellfire mana reduction.
The first activated consumer is Firebolt; the same validated fields are now
available as the remaining native spell behaviors are ported.

Content schema 0.10 adds Lightning's character-level random damage, Q6 damage
scale, and secondary-projectile lifetime fields. Validation reserves
`LightningSegment` for runtime creation and rejects incomplete controller
definitions before activation.

Content schema 0.11 adds Flash's repeated-roll count, character-level bonus,
per-spell-level effect scaling, and post-scale percentage fields. Validation
reserves `FlashBottom` and `FlashTop` for runtime creation and rejects incomplete
or non-Magic Flash definitions before activation.

Content schema 0.12 adds Healing's initial, character-level, and spell-level
random ranges and fixed additions plus its Q6 scale, while class rows add the
self-Healing percentage. Validation rejects incomplete Healing behavior and
healing-only tuning attached to any other behavior.

Content schema 0.13 adds the validated Teleport behavior and base spell row.
Teleport accepts only one stationary two-tick controller with no damage,
healing, status, or area effect; destination occupancy remains runtime state
rather than content data.

Content schema 0.14 adds validated Resurrection tuning and the base spell row.
Resurrection accepts no damage, healing, status, or area tuning, requires one
stationary beam with positive lifetime, and validates its life scale and search
radius. `ResurrectionBeam` remains runtime-owned and cannot be selected by a
content row.

Content schema 0.15 adds `default_start` level selection and validated
restart-in-town fields to `combat.tsv`. The base pack now distinguishes town
level 0 from default dungeon level 1 and validates that the configured restart
tile is walkable before activation.

Content schema 0.16 adds validated player-death gold divisor, projected
maximum-stack, native item type/index, and drop-search radius fields to
`combat.tsv`. The module uses the activated values for death, pickup, and save
validation while protocol clients continue to consume generic player and
world-item projections.

Content schema 0.17 adds the validated
`suppress_multiplayer_death_drops` level flag. The server applies it only when
explicit session mode is multiplayer, matching native level-16 and arena
behavior without baking map IDs into engine code.

Content schema 0.18 adds `combat.tsv`'s stable `pvp_ear_item_id`, each class's
validated `pvp_ear_cursor_graphic`, and the normalized native ear row in
`items.tsv`. Activation rejects an ear definition that does not project native
item index 23 and miscellaneous ID 44.

Content schema 0.19 adds the validated Mana Shield behavior and base spell row.
Validation requires an immediate self effect, a safe learned-level divisor, and
exactly one Mana Shield definition; other behaviors cannot carry its tuning.

Content schema 0.20 adds the validated Stone Curse behavior, base spell row,
and `monsters.tsv` immunity flag. Validation constrains its stationary
monster-target controller, duration arithmetic, shatter phase, and crawl radius;
other behaviors cannot carry Stone Curse tuning.

Content schema 0.21 adds the validated Infravision behavior and base spell row.
Validation constrains it to one immediate self status with zero magnitude and
safe duration-growth arithmetic; other behaviors cannot carry Infravision
tuning.

Content schema 0.22 adds the validated Phasing behavior and base spell row.
Validation constrains it to one stationary two-tick controller with bounded,
ordered axis-offset tuning; other behaviors cannot carry Phasing tuning.

Content schema 0.23 adds the validated Fireball behavior and base spell row.
Validation constrains its bounded random-damage work, level-scaled speed,
single fire projectile, radius-one impact, resistance divisor, and persistent
explosion; other behaviors cannot carry Fireball-only tuning.

Content schema 0.24 adds the validated Heal Other behavior, base spell row, and
`heal_other_spell_percent` class column. Validation requires one immediate
living-player effect with native random Q6 scaling and prevents unrelated
behaviors from carrying its healing tuning.

Content schema 0.25 adds the validated Search behavior and base spell row.
Validation requires one zero-magnitude immediate self status with bounded
character- and spell-level duration tuning; unrelated behaviors cannot carry
Search-only columns.

Content schema 0.26 adds the stable `spell:identify` identity required by the
Bard loadout. Activation resolves that symbol into the module's item-service
policy, so external content cannot silently assign the class skill by an
unvalidated host constant.

Content schema 0.27 adds stable `spell:repair` identity `26` for the Warrior
loadout. Activation binds it to the module's native repair policy; the service
uses existing authoritative durability, character-level, and RNG state rather
than client or host constants.

Content schema 0.28 adds stable `spell:recharge` identity `27` for the Sorcerer
loadout and the native `staff_level` spell field. Activation binds the skill to
the authoritative recharge policy, and the content value supplies the exact
character-level divisor used by its shared RNG sequence.

## Near-term priorities

1. Expand authoritative combat and spell coverage beyond Firebolt, Charged
   Bolt, Fireball, Lightning, Flash, Healing, Heal Other, Stone Curse,
   Infravision, Search, Phasing, Mana Shield, Teleport, and Resurrection,
   including remaining class modifiers, scaling and targeting rules.
2. Expand external content coverage, including remaining Hellfire monster,
   level, quest, and item metadata and authoritative gameplay definitions.
3. Grow the Godot client from a protocol demonstration into a complete playable
   presentation client using production assets.
4. Add the missing replay, reconnect, multiplayer, and long-running soak cases.
5. Add host-controlled live ruleset replacement with session migration and safe
   retirement; generalize adapter selection when a second adapter exists.
6. Replace the remaining Lua capability destinations and remove Lua only after
   every removal gate is satisfied.
